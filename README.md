Here I will upload the final work of the Programming I subject. The statement is as follows:
The aim is to develop a program that allows creating personalized letters using a contact book and text file templates in HTML format. The program must offer functionality through an interactive menu on the command line, where the user can select specific tasks or exit the program. After completing a task, the menu will be displayed again, and the program will only end when the user chooses to exit.

1.Generate custom letters:
-Enter the name of the letter
-Select the template to use
-Select the contact list to use (or the entire phonebook)
-Generate custom versions of the template for each contact in a directory.

2.Manage contact list:
-Add a contact
-Check contact details
-Show all contacts
-Show contacts that (partially) match the first or last name entered
-Show the contact that matches the email address entered

3.Delete a contact:
-Confirmation before deletion
-Also deletion of all distribution lists.

4.Manage distribution lists:
-Create a distribution list from the name entered
-Delete a distribution list based on the name entered
-Select a distribution list from the name entered
-Add a contact from the entered email
-Delete a contact from the entered email (Note: the user must exist in the contact book.)

5.Exit program: Allows the user to exit the program.
